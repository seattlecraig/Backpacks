# Backpacks - End User Guide

## What Are Backpacks?

Backpacks are portable storage containers that you can carry in your inventory and access anywhere! Think of them as personal chests that you can take with you on adventures.

There are two types of backpacks:

1. **Personal Backpack** - A 54-slot backpack you access with the `/bp` command (if your server has this enabled)
2. **Item Backpacks** - Physical backpack items you can carry, trade, and store in chests

## Personal Backpack (/bp Command)

If your server has enabled personal backpacks, you can access yours by typing:

```
/bp
```

This opens a 54-slot storage (double chest size) that's tied to your account. Your personal backpack:
- Is always 54 slots
- Cannot be traded or dropped
- Is accessed only through the command
- Requires the `backpacks.use` permission (ask your server admin if it's not working)

## Item Backpacks

Item backpacks are physical items you can hold, store, trade, and use anywhere.

### Getting Your First Backpack

Backpacks can be found by opening Rewards keys in the lobby, or purchased using in game currency via the /shop command. You can also acquire the backpack upgrade via the /shop command.

### How to Use Your Backpack

#### Opening Your Backpack

1. Hold the backpack item in your hand
2. **Right-click** (either in the air or on a block)
3. A storage GUI will open showing your backpack's contents
4. Move items in and out just like any chest!

#### Closing Your Backpack

Simply press **ESC** or your inventory key to close the backpack. You'll see a green "Backpack saved!" message confirming your items were stored safely.

> **Important:** Your backpack contents are saved immediately when you close it, so your items are always safe!

## Backpack Capacities

Item backpacks come in two sizes:

### Standard Backpack (27 Slots)
- Same storage as a single chest
- The default size when you receive a new backpack
- Still plenty of room for your adventures!

### Upgraded Backpack (54 Slots)
- Same storage as a double chest
- Upgraded using a **Backpack Capacity Doubler**
- Perfect for long expeditions and serious storage needs

## Upgrading Your Backpack

### What You Need
- A standard 27-slot backpack
- A **Backpack Capacity Doubler** (a special paper item with aqua text)

### How to Upgrade

**Method 1: In Your Inventory**
1. Open your inventory
2. Hold the Capacity Doubler in your cursor (pick it up)
3. Right-click on the backpack
4. ✨ Your backpack is now upgraded to 54 slots!

**Method 2: In a Chest**
1. Place your backpack in a chest
2. Pick up the Capacity Doubler with your cursor
3. Right-click on the backpack in the chest
4. ✨ Instant upgrade without taking the backpack out!

> **Note:** You can only upgrade a backpack once. Backpacks that are already 54 slots cannot be upgraded further.

> **Important:** The Capacity Doubler only works on a single backpack at a time. If you have a stack of backpacks, you'll need to separate them first.

## Important Things to Know

### Each Backpack is Unique
Every backpack has its own unique storage! Even if two backpacks look identical, they have completely separate contents. This means:
- You can own multiple backpacks with different items
- Trading backpacks means trading their contents too
- Don't accidentally drop your favorite backpack!

### Backpacks Inside Backpacks
**You CANNOT put backpacks inside other backpacks.** This prevents data issues and keeps your items safe. If you try, you'll see a red error message: "You cannot put a backpack inside another backpack!"

### Safe Storage
Your backpack contents are:
- ✅ Saved immediately when you close the GUI
- ✅ Protected even if the server crashes
- ✅ Preserved through server restarts
- ✅ Independent from other players' backpacks

## Tips and Tricks

### Organization
- Keep separate backpacks for different purposes (mining supplies, farming tools, building blocks)
- Rename backpacks in an anvil to remember what's inside ("Mining Pack", "Farm Supplies")
- Store extra backpacks in your ender chest for safekeeping

### Upgrade Timing
- You don't need to empty a backpack before upgrading it
- All your items stay in place - you just get more space!
- Upgrade before long adventures to maximize storage

### Trading
- Backpacks make great trade goods - they come with their contents!
- Be careful when trading - make sure you know what's inside first!
- Consider emptying backpacks before selling unless the contents are part of the deal

### Travel
- Keep a backpack in your hotbar for quick access during adventures
- Store emergency supplies (food, torches, blocks) in an easily accessible backpack
- Upgraded backpacks are perfect for long mining trips

## Need Help?

If you're having issues with backpacks:
1. Make sure you're right-clicking with the backpack in your hand
2. Check that you're clicking on a backpack item (should have gold text and glow)
3. For `/bp` command issues, ask your server admin if you have the required permission
4. Ask your server administrators for assistance
5. Report any bugs to the server staff
