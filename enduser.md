2. **Right-click** (either in the air or on a block)
3. A storage GUI will open showing your backpack's contents
4. Move items in and out just like any chest!

### Closing Your Backpack

Simply press **ESC** or your inventory key to close the backpack. You'll see a green "Backpack saved!" message confirming your items were stored safely.

> **Important:** Your backpack contents are saved immediately when you close it, so your items are always safe!

## Backpack Capacities

Backpacks come in two sizes:

### Standard Backpack (27 Slots)
- Same storage as a single chest
- The default size when you receive a new backpack

## Important Things to Know

### Each Backpack is Unique
Every backpack has its own unique storage! Even if two backpacks look identical, they have completely separate contents. This means:
- You can own multiple backpacks with different items
- Trading backpacks means trading their contents too
- Don't accidentally drop your favorite backpack!

### Backpacks Inside Backpacks?
**By default, you CANNOT put backpacks inside other backpacks.** This prevents data issues and keeps your items safe. If you try, you'll see a red error message.

> **Server Note:** Some servers may enable nested backpacks in their configuration, but this is not recommended due to potential issues.

### Safe Storage
Your backpack contents are:
- ✅ Saved immediately when you close the GUI
- ✅ Protected even if the server crashes
- ✅ Preserved through server restarts
- ✅ Independent from other players' backpacks

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I lose items from my backpack?**
A: No! Items are saved immediately when you close the backpack GUI. Your items are safe even if the server crashes right after you close it.

**Q: Can other players access my backpack?**
A: No! Only you can open your backpacks. Each backpack stores its own contents independently.

**Q: How many backpacks can I have?**
A: As many as you can fit in your inventory and chests! Each backpack has its own separate storage.

**Q: What happens if I upgrade a backpack that's already full?**
A: Great news! All your items stay in their original positions (slots 0-26), and you get 27 additional empty slots (27-53) for more storage.

**Q: Can I rename my backpack with an anvil?**
A: You can rename it, but the storage will still work! The backpack uses an invisible unique ID, not its name, to track its contents.

**Q: What items can I NOT store in backpacks?**
A: By default, you cannot store other backpacks inside a backpack. Everything else should work fine!

**Q: Do backpacks take durability damage?**
A: No! The enchanted glow is just for visual effect. Backpacks never break or wear out.

## Tips and Tricks

### Organization
- Keep separate backpacks for different purposes (mining supplies, farming tools, building blocks)
- Rename backpacks in an anvil to remember what's inside ("Mining Pack", "Farm Supplies")
- Store extra backpacks in your ender chest for safekeeping

### Upgrade Timing
- You don't need to empty a backpack before upgrading it
- All your items stay in place - you just get more space!
- Upgrade before long adventures to maximize storage

### Trading
- Backpacks make great trade goods - they come with their contents!
- Be careful when trading - make sure you know what's inside first!
- Consider emptying backpacks before selling unless the contents are part of the deal

### Travel
- Keep a backpack in your hotbar for quick access during adventures
- Store emergency supplies (food, torches, blocks) in an easily accessible backpack
- Upgraded backpacks are perfect for long mining trips
